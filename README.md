# ezScheme

ezScheme is a SaaS platform designed to simplify access to government schemes by consolidating information and tailoring it to individual needs. This project is a continuation of the [ezScheme](https://github.com/APS4087/ezScheme) project, with a focus on building a comprehensive solution that offers personalized recommendations and detailed information about various government schemes.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of ezScheme is to make it easier for individuals and businesses to find and apply for government schemes that are relevant to them. The platform achieves this through a combination of features, including:

- **Personalized Recommendations**: A recommendation engine that identifies relevant schemes based on user input and provides personalized suggestions.
- **Virtual Assistant**: A virtual assistant that can answer detailed queries about different schemes and guide users through the application process.
- **Video Content**: Personalized video content that explains the benefits and application process of various schemes.
- **Future Enhancements**: Planned features include smarter scheme recommendations, topic-based model questions, saved business context, and predictive scheme relevance.
